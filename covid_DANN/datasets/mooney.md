# Mooney dataset:
> Downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Can't find Mooney in the original paper [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76550-z) | [pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76550-z.pdf) so terminating investigation here.

## Relationship to COVIDNET
- [Covid-NET](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net) refers to the machine learning model created by Wang et al, and uses a dataset called CovidX ([more info](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net/blob/master/docs/COVIDx.md)) which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2?select=competition_test).
- The CovidX dataset uses [tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) which uses the dataset from the paper **Can AI Help in Screening Viral and COVID-19 Pneumonia** [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144185) | [PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144185).
- This paper introduces a new dataset that contains the Mooney [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
