# Mooney Dataset - Flattened:
This is a modified version of the Mooney dataset, downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
After downloading the dataset, run the script [mooney-transform.py](./mooney_transform.py) to generate the metadata.csv file and copy all of the images from the subdirectory into a new folder in the root called "images".
